An IoT smart solar panel system with automatic adjustment can optimize energy generation by continuously aligning itself with the sun's position. This system integrates sensors to monitor sunlight intensity and a servo motor to physically adjust the panel's angle. The setup uses a Wi-Fi module to transmit real-time sensor data to a cloud-based platform like ThingSpeak for monitoring and analysis. Hereâ€™s how this system can be developed using C programming, ThingSpeak, and the necessary hardware.
